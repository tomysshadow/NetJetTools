NetJet Simulator 2.0.0
By Anthony Kleine

	This is a simulator for the Hasbro NetJet Controller device. It allows the use of an Xbox 360 Controller or Keyboard in place of the NetJet Controller. If a real NetJet Controller is connected, it will use the NetJet Controller input. If an Xbox 360 Controller is connected, it will still use the NetJet Controller input, but prefer the Xbox 360 Controller input. Keyboard input is preferred over any Controller. Buttons are not cumulative (pressing left on both the NetJet Controller and the Keyboard will not result in moving twice as fast in-game.) A game key is still required - this is not a keygen.

	A Proxy DLL which resides in the install directory is used. It relies on the availability of the original NetJetController.DLL, renamed to NetJetController_orig.DLL. A hook is used to prevent key presses from sending multiple times.
